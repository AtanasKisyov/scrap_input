Scrap Input is a web application under development.

The purpose is to register and track the scrap of materials on your production shop floor.

User groups:
1. Scrapper
2. Controller
3. Staff
4. Administrator(super user)

Scrappers and Controllers will be created only by staff members/not everyone should be allowed to make input/.

Scrapper role is to register the material numbers and quantities in the application.

Controller role is to compare the input in the app vs the actual scrap that is handed to them(weight)

Staff users will be able to monitor the scrapped quantities and see automatically generated reports
regarding most scrap coming from an area, problematic materials and user accuracy.

The administrator has full control of the application.
